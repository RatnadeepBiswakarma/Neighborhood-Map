# Neighborhood Map Project by Ratnadeep

---

This is a React based single page application presenting some locations of London. We can see the location to find Restaurant, Hotel, Library, Gallery, Statue etc. By default some places of London are pointed on the map. We can sort them by typing name in the search box or by selecting the specified name from the list. We can see the name and address of the place by clicking either on the name on the list or the marker on the map. Please follow the instructions mentioned below to run it in your machine.

## Functionality

1. By default all the locations are rendered on the map.
2. To filter the locations type the name or select any of the list.
3. Click on the marker or the name to see more info.
4. Click on the show all button to display back all markers.
5. The app will work offline in build mode. See below how run it in build mode.
